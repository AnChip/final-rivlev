# CISC 3142 Final Exam

This repository will contain your copy of the final exam for this class. It will be made available at the time of the final exam, on Thursday May 21 at 6pm.

Meanwhile, make sure that you can follow the workflow for taking the exam:

   1. Open file "final.txt" in your browser 
   3. Click "edit" \(the pencil icon on the top right\)
   3. Answer the questions. Surround all inline code \(snippets of code inside text\) with **backticks** \(\`&lt;code&gt;\`\). Surround code blocks with **triple backticks** \(\`\`\`&lt;code&gt;\`\`\`\).
   4. Scroll down to where it says "Commit changes". Select the radio button that says "Create a **new branch** for this commit and start a pull request." Click the green button that says "Propose file change".
   5. In the pull request dialog, tag me (@rivlev) and click **Create pull request**. Ignore the big green merge button!

Do this early so if you have issues you can get in touch with me to resolve them before the final.
